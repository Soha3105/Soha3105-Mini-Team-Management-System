# Soha3105-Mini-Team-Management-System
Mini Team Management System 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
This is a simple console-based Python project that I built using Google Colab.
The idea behind this project was to understand how basic team management works and to practice core Python concepts through a real-life use case.
The system allows a team lead to add team members, assign tasks, update task status, and check overall team progress using a menu-driven interface.

Why I Built This Project
As a student, I wanted to:
Practice Python basics in a practical way
Learn how menu-driven console programs work
Understand task tracking and progress calculation logic
This project helped me strengthen my fundamentals like loops, conditions, and data handling.

Technologies Used
Python 3
Google Colab
Console / Command Line Interface


What This Project Can Do
Add team members with their role and assigned task
Automatically set task status as Pending
Display all team members and their task details
Update task status (Pending / In Progress / Completed)
Generate a simple team progress report
Exit the program safely

How the Program Works

The program runs in the console and shows a menu where the user selects options by entering numbers.
Based on the input, the system performs the required action like adding members, updating tasks, or showing progress.

Sample Menu
Team Management System
1. Add Team Member
2. View Team Members
3. Update Task Status
4. Team Progress Report
5. Exit

Sample Progress Report
Total Team Members: 3
Completed Tasks: 1
Pending Tasks: 2
Completion Percentage: 33.33%

How to Run the Project:
Using Google Colab
Open Google Colab
Upload the Mini_Team_Management_System.ipynb file
Run all cells
Follow the instructions shown in the console
Using Local System
Convert the notebook to a .py file (optional)

Run:
python filename.py

What I Learned from This Project:
Writing clean, readable Python code
Handling user input in console applications
Using Python data structures to store information
Calculating percentages and generating reports
Thinking logically about real-world problems
